*This guide assumes that you are using an Arch Based distro with KDE Plasma that ISN'T immutable. Immutable distros' file systems cannot be modified. You need to be able to modify these system files to be able to truly follow this guide. Immutable distros have great benefits, but they just aren't for me and won't fit this guide.*
