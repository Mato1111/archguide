# Guide to Arch Linux w/ KDE Plasma
# [WIP]

This is meant for a friend and not the general public. You may use it if you'd like, I can't stop you.
This is mostly just an info dump of everything I've learned that would be useful to have. It's far from perfect and won't be for everyone, it's just what works best for me.
I'm also very bored, that's why I'm making this.

*This guide assumes that you are using an Arch Based distro with KDE Plasma that ISN'T immutable. Immutable distros' file systems cannot be modified. You need to be able to modify these system files to be able to truly follow this guide. Immutable distros have great benefits, but they just aren't for me and won't fit this guide.*
