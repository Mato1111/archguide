Paru is a better way to install packages to your system. Install Paru with `yay -S paru`, assuming you already have `yay`. If not, you can install `paru` by following [these instructions.](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) 

Now run the command `sudo /etc/paru.conf`.
Next, remove the Hashtag in front of the lines that say, `BottomUp`, `SudoLoop`, `CombinedUpgrade`, and `UpgradeMenu`. This will make it behave more like `yay`, which is a bit more user friendly (for me at least). 
You can now save it with `ctrl+s` and quit with `ctrl+q`.
