The CachyOS repos/repositories are great alternatives to the official repos that offer more optimized applications and faster install speeds.

**This will be the first step after installing your system before doing anything else.**

## Installing
To install the repos run the following command:

```
cd ~/Downloads && wget https://mirror.cachyos.org/cachyos-repo.tar.xz && tar xvf cachyos-repo.tar.xz && cd cachyos-repo && sudo ./cachyos-repo.sh
```

Once it has finished, you may proceed to the [[Installing Packages|next page.]]
